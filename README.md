# Kickstarter Campaign Analysis
## An analysis of Kickstarter data to uncover trends in successful vs unsuccessful campaigns
###Context
This analysis of Kickstarter campaigns was created to guide future campaigns, with an emphasis on US based plays, and British based musicals.
I am focused on US plays to help a fictional playwrite plan a Kickstarter campaign to fund a production of a play in the US. The first step in analysis was breaking down the types and subtypes of campaigns, and sorting by outcome. In the file is a pivot chart showing the theater subtypes' outcomes for all campagins in my data set. It shows that plays are the most started campagin, but also more often successful. 

###Data Breakdown
I wanted to see if the time of year is correlated to any successes for plays, and it shows that the summer months are the most common time of year to start theater campaigns, but also the most common time of year for successes. 

###Statistics
Finally, I wanted some firm statistics to give to my fictional client, so using measures of central tendencies and spread, I created the Descriptive Statistics worksheet tab. Looking at the central tendencies, successful US based kickstarters for plays have a lower goal than failed kickstarters. Successful kickstarters also have more pledged, as well as backers and average pledge per backer. What causes a someone to become a backer and how much they choose to pledge would require more subjective research. 
My fictional client was also interested in British musicals, so I created a Box and Whisker chart to quickly show some stats. The client will have to re filter the data selections to British musicals to see the data. 

###Conclusion & Recommendations
My conclusion is that Louise is much less likely to have a successful kickstarter campaign if she continues to ask for $10,000.
