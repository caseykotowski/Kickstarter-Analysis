# Kickstarter Campaign Analysis
## An analysis of Kickstarter data to uncover trends in successful vs unsuccessful campaigns
### Context
This analysis of Kickstarter campaigns was created to guide future campaigns, with an emphasis on US based plays, and British based musicals.
I am focused on US plays to help a fictional playwrite plan a Kickstarter campaign to fund a production of a play in the US. The first step in analysis was breaking down the types and subtypes of campaigns, and sorting by outcome. In the file is a pivot chart showing the subtypes' outcomes for all campagins in my data set. Plays are by far the most commonly successful campagin subcategory. ---

To confirm this, I further sorted the outcomes by subcategory for just the Theater category group.

### Data Breakdown
Now that we understand that it's possible to be successful in fundraising for a play, I wanted to see if there are any other variables that increase success. We have the data for when campagins are started, so I sorted by date. Looking at the below chart time of year is correlated to success in plays, and it shows that the summer months are the most common time of year to start theater campaigns and the most common time of year for successes. Specifically, May is the most successful month.

### Statistics
Finally, I wanted some firm statistics to give to my fictional client, so using measures of central tendencies and spread, I created the Descriptive Statistics worksheet tab. Please see this tab in the excel file for all of the details. Looking at the central tendencies, successful US based kickstarters for plays have a 2x lower goal than failed kickstarters. Successful kickstarters also have more pledged, as well as backers and average pledge per backer. What causes a someone to become a backer and how much they choose to pledge would require more subjective research. ---
### Other Interests
My fictional client was also interested in British musicals, so I created a Box and Whisker chart to quickly show some stats. Her goal of Â£4,000 is incredibly close to the mean, which is much higher than the median (there are some outliers present), so again it's a lofty goal. The mean amount pledged - regardless of outcome - is much lower than the mean for goals.

### Conclusion & Recommendations
From the data, it would seem that campagins with goals under $5,000 are the most likely to succeed. Louise's original goal is $10,000, so I think she would have a better chance starting with a smaller fundraiser - $5,000 max.
